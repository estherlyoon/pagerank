memory layout:
        - words are 8 bytes wide
        - first array is of length N_VERTICES
            - per 2-word entry:
                - first integer is number of in-edges vertex has
                - second integer is number of out-edges vertex has
        - second array stores in-edge vertex IDs (IEV) for each vertex in first array
            - one word per IEV
            - e.g., will store [v0's IEVs | v1's IEVs ... | v(n-1)'s IEV]
		- 0-padding is added at the end of the file to account for the two write spaces used for recording pageranks
