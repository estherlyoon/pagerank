memory layout:
	- first integer is number of vertices in graph (V)
	- second integer is number of edges in graph (E)
	- vertex map, with each indice corresponding to a node and element denoting offset in in-edges graph (V length)
	- edge map for in-edges per node
	- array of length V with how many out-edges each node has
